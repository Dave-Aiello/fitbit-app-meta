  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the OpenClaw Fitbit App (the "App") handles data.</p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>The App is a personal, owner-operated integration used to retrieve Fitbit account data for personal productivity and health tracking workflows.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
  <p>With your permission via Fitbit OAuth, the App may access Fitbit data such as profile, activity, sleep, heart rate, and weight data, depending on granted scopes.</p>

  <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>Data is used only to display and analyze personal Fitbit information for the authorized account holder. Data is not sold and is not used for advertising.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Data is not shared with third parties except as required for the App to function with Fitbit's API, or if required by law.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>OAuth tokens and related configuration are stored locally on the owner’s system with restricted file permissions. Reasonable safeguards are used to protect access.</p>

  <h2>6. Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>You may revoke app access at any time in Fitbit settings. Locally stored tokens can be removed by signing out of the CLI integration.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App depends on Fitbit’s APIs and services, which are governed by Fitbit’s own terms and privacy policy.</p>
